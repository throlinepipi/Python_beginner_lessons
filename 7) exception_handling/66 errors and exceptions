errors -- the problems in a program that will cause the program to stop the execution
exceptions -- raised where some internal events occur that changes the normal flow of the program

A statement may cause an error during execution when it is not syntactically incorrect.
Such errors that occur at runtime are known as exceptions.
An event may occur while running the program and may even disturb the regular flow of the program, known as an exception.

Whenever a program meets a condition that it cannot deal with, then an exception is raised.

Types of exceptions
1) In-built or Pre-defined exceptions
2) Customized or programmatic or user-defined exceptions
